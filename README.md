Excited to share my latest project: Bloomoraa

Bloomoraa is a responsive eCommerce website for baby care and family care products â€“ but with a twist!

ðŸ’¡ My idea: Instead of making users search separately for skincare, haircare, suncare, or kids products, I designed four dedicated pages within a single website:

â€“ Skin Care

â€“ Hair Care

â€“ Sun Care

â€“ Kids Care

This makes browsing and shopping easier, faster, and more organized for users who want specific products without navigating complex menus.

ðŸ›  Tech stack: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

âœ¨ Features:

â€“ Category-based pages

â€“ Dynamic product badges (e.g., Best Seller, New Launch)

â€“ Fully responsive design

â€“ Deployed live using Netlify

This project helped me explore user-centered design, thinking not just about how it looks â€“ but how it feels to navigate.
